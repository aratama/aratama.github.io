<span class="header">about</span><br>
Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra is a free orchestral sample
library. While not as advanced or ambitious in scope as commercial
offerings, SSO contains all the basic building blocks for creating real
virtual orchestrations. It's primarily aimed at beginners, but also
more experienced composers looking for something lightweight and/or
portable might find it useful.<br>
<br>
<span class="header">format</span><br>
SSO comes in <a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/devxchange/sfz.asp">sfz
format</a>, which is a powerful, open, non-monolithic
sample format. It consists of a plain text file with an sfz extension
that holds all sample playback parameters, and a set of sound
samples in wave format which are referenced by the sfz file. This means
that sfz files can be edited with any plain text editor, and the
samples can be edited with any audio editor that loads wave files.<br>
<br>
<span class="header">compatibility</span><br>
Many samplers allow you to
load sfz files, but few support all the format's features. SSO works
properly on <a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/products/dimensionpro/">Cakewalk
Dimension&nbsp;Pro</a>/<a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/products/dimensionle/">LE</a>,
<a href="http://www.ariaengine.com/">ARIA Engine</a>,
and the free <a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/support/project5/sfz.aspx">SFZ
Player</a>.&nbsp;The library has also been tested on
Shorcircuit 1,
discoDSP HighLife and WusikStation 6, all of which appear to have very
poor sfz support and are not recommended.<br>
<br>
<span class="header">samples</span><br>
The SSO samples are stereo, 16 bit, 44kHz. Melodic instruments and
chromatic percussion are
sampled in minor 3rds. Staccato/pizzicato patches have 2x round-robin.
All samples have varying amounts of stage ambience, depending
on their front-to-back placement, but in addition to that a good hall
reverb is a must.<br>
<br>
<span class="header">licensing</span><br>
SSO is a free (as in speech, and beer) library released under the
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Creative
Commons Sampling Plus 1.0 license</a>.<br>
<br>
<span class="header">sections and instruments</span><br>

Florestan</a> and <a href="http://www.ethanwiner.com/ewsf2.html">Ethan Winer</a>.<br>
<br>
In the case of a few very old soundfonts I
have no idea who the original authors were or what licensing might
apply. But as these files have been modified by different people and
included in countless GM banks and other soundfont compilations over
the last decade, I'm assuming that they are to be considered public
domain or at least free to use for sampling projects.<br>
<br>
I have done my very best to avoid samples of questionable legality, but
as it is impossible for me to know the exact origin of everything (i.e.
I have no way of knowing if a soundfont labeled as "public domain"
isn't actually sampled from a proprietary source), I would appreciate
if you let me know if you find anything fishy. <br>
<br>
<span class="header">faq (fully anticipated questions)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How
was the library created?</span><br>
<br>
As I don't have a real orchestra to sample, I settled for building
virtual sections from solo instruments. For this I used the <a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/Products/sfz/">sfz+
soundfont player</a>. Some sections were subtly layered with
synths (ZebraCM, Synth1) for added lushness. The sections were then
placed in an
artificial space using <a href="http://www.liquidsonics.com/software_reverberate.htm">LiquidSonics
Reverberate</a> and a scoring stage IR
from <a href="http://www.samplicity.com/bricasti-m7-impulse-responses/">Samplicity's
Bricasti M7 library</a>. The instrument ranges were
rendered at highest possible quality, split up into individual notes,
normalized and then mapped as sfz files. The programs used were <a href="http://www.cockos.com/reaper/index.php">Cockos
REAPER</a>, Steinberg Wavelab 4, <a href="http://audio.clockbeat.com/sfZed.html">sfZed</a>
and <a href="http://liquidninja.com/metapad/">Metapad</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
no chromatic multisamples?</span><br>
<br>
While it&nbsp;would certainly be possible to render and map all
sections
chromatically, it would mean a marginal increase in quality at the
price of a tripled file size. I simply didn't think it was worth it, as
any good sampler will be able to stretch a sample one semitone up and
down without any significant sound degradation. Also, many of the
instruments were not chromatically sampled to begin with.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
no velocity layers/additional articulations?</span><br>
<br>
Very few free samples come in different velocities, and I deemed it
better to forego velocity
layers completely than to have it on a few sections and not the others.
As
for articulations, I have done what I could with the samples I had to
work with. Some section staccatos were possible to fake with truncated
sustain samples and some layering/doubling voodoo, others were not.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
16 bit and not 24?</span><br>
<br>
First
of all, SSO has no ultra-soft velocity layers that might require a
lower noise floor so the benefits of distributing the samples as 24
bits are debatable. Secondly, SFZ Player doesn't like 24 bit samples so
it's a question of compatibility as well. Having said that, all samples
were of course rendered and edited in 24 bits and if there's interest I
might release a 24 bit version later on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
loops on some sections and not others?</span><br>
<br>
Only sections that can sustain indefinitely have loops, i.e.
strings. Sustained brass and winds have a a set duration, just like in
reality.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
are some solo samples so short?</span><br>
<br>
An
aesthetic choice, plain and simple. In my opinion, nothing ruins the
expressiveness and realism of a solo instrument more than a looped
vibrato. A short note with a natural decay is much preferable to a
looped one, even though it does limit the usefulness of the solo
instruments somewhat.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why
are some solo instruments missing?</span><br>
<br>
Because I have not been able to find any samples of good enough quality
in the free realm.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">What
about different sample formats?</span><br>
<br>
Other formats (e.g. Kontakt, Gigastudio) might be made available later
on, provided that someone offers to convert/test/tweak
everything, as I have no way of doing this myself. <br>
<br>
<span class="header"></span><span class="header">contributing</span><br>
If
you would like to contribute to this project, there are several things
you could do. 1) Make sure to report any bugs you may find so that they
can be fixed. 2) Http mirrors of the download would be very
welcome, so that's something to consider if you have web space and
bandwidth to spare. 3) If you make any cool custom patches, please
submit them! 4) More demos for showcasing the library are needed, so if
you compose something nice with SSO I'd love to hear it. 5)<br>
<br>
If
you have any samples that you think would be a good addition to the
project, please bear in mind that I can only accept material released
under a compatible license, i.e. free for
reuse/modification/distribution. So, "I found these files on the net"
isn't going to cut it. I will need some hard facts on where the samples
are from and how they may be used.<br>
<br>
